<title>Why teach multi-threading in application development classes?</title>
<p>Many people study Computer Science, and many times they will at one point get classes on application development.
<p>Often, a student will be taught Java (or C#).
While I have many gripes with that language and how it is taught (why do people teach inheritance before interfaces?), this post will be about multi-threading.
I expect readers to have at least a fundamental grasp of what a thread is.
<p>Let us first have a look at what threads are useful for: <ul>
<li>having light-weight workers in a server-like process. In this context, light-weight means that creating a thread is usually much cheaper than creating a whole new process with its own address space.
<li>doing background tasks in a GUI program
<li>taking advantage of multiple processors (cores, hardware threads, whatever, it doesn't matter in this context) in a modern computer.
